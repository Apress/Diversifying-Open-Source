# Procedural Documentation

This directory contains documents that define **repeatable
processes**, the procedures or how the project community do things.

These texts are consulted when uncertainty arises.
They are designed to set up repeatable processes, so the same decisions
don't have to be made again and again. This reduces day-to-day effort by
relying on pre-defined procedures. 

Procedural answers questions such as:

- What is the process?
- What happens if something goes wrong?
- How are decisions make?
- How are responsibilities rotated or transferred?

Examples include security handling, accessibility practices, funding
transparency, decision logs, and audit checklists.

## Purpose

These documents define processes, procedures, and standards that guide project
operations. They are updated less frequently than daily operational documents
but more frequently than long-term governance documents.

## Procedural Checklist

- [ ] Decisions are documented
- [ ] Emergency paths are defined
- [ ] Responsibilities are explicit
- [ ] Processes reduce day-to-day friction
- [ ] Updates are intentional and traceable

### Contribution taxonomy

Within `Procedural/`, the **contribution taxonomy** defines how different
kinds of work are classified.

It supports:

- consistent labeling of issues and pull requests,
- visibility of non-code labor,
- fairer routing and review,
- later summaries and recognition.

### Metrics and signals

The `Procedural/metrics/` folder contains **community health and
sustainability signals**, informed by CHAOSS and related research.

Metrics are used to:

- surface patterns and risks,
- reflect on participation, workload, and sustainability,
- support governance discussions.
