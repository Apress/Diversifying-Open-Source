# Accessibility

Accessibility defines how this project reduces barriers to participation and use
across different abilities, contexts, and modes of interaction.

It is treated as a **procedural commitment**, not as a final polish step or a static checklist.
This document exists to avoid ad-hoc accessibility decisions and to make trade-offs explicit.

## What accessibility covers

Accessibility in this project may include:
- interaction methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, assistive technology)
- visual presentation (contrast, layout, typography)
- cognitive load (clarity, structure, pacing)
- sensory considerations (motion, sound, color use)
- language complexity and readability
- participation pathways (contribution, review, support)
- documentation structure and navigation

Accessibility applies to both **the software** and **how people collaborate around it**.

## Accessibility as a shared responsibility

Accessibility is not owned by a single role.
Contributors, reviewers, maintainers, and document authors all participate in reducing barriers.

Lack of expertise is not a reason to avoid raising accessibility concerns.

---

## How accessibility issues are raised

Accessibility-related issues can be raised by:
- opening an issue labeled `accessibility`
- noting concerns in a pull request
- raising questions during review or discussion

Reports do not need to include a solution.
Describing the barrier is sufficient.

---

## Review and decision process

When accessibility concerns are raised:
1. the barrier is acknowledged
2. possible approaches are discussed
3. trade-offs are made explicit
4. decisions are documented when needed

Accessibility regressions are treated as bugs.

---

## Design and documentation practices

Where possible, contributors should:
- use clear headings and consistent structure
- avoid relying on color alone to convey meaning
- provide text alternatives for non-text content
- prefer plain language and explain necessary jargon
- make defaults explicit rather than assumed

These practices support a wide range of access needs.

---

## Constraints and trade-offs

Not all accessibility issues can be resolved immediately.

When constraints exist:
- they should be documented
- partial improvements are preferred to inaction
- future work should be noted when possible

Silence is treated as a decision and should be avoided.

---

## Credit and recognition

Accessibility work is credited in [`Long-Term/CREDIT.md`](Long-Term/CREDIT.md), including review, testing, research, and advocacy.

This includes labor that does not result in code changes.

---

## Review and evolution

Accessibility practices are reviewed periodically as the project, its contributors, and its users change.

This document may evolve as understanding deepens.
