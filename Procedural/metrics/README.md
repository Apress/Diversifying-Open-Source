# Metrics

This directory contains documentation about how the project measures and evaluates its practices.

Metrics exist to make patterns visible and to support evidence-based decisions.
They are not treated as neutral or objective, but as tools that require interpretation and context.

---

## Purpose

Metrics documentation helps:
- make measurement choices explicit
- understand what is being measured and why
- identify gaps and biases in data collection
- support accountability and transparency

---

## Contents

- **[chaoss-mapping.md](chaoss-mapping.md)** - Mapping to CHAOSS metrics framework
- **[dashboard.md](dashboard.md)** - Dashboard configuration and interpretation
- **[data-sources.md](data-sources.md)** - Data sources and collection methods
- **[review-notes.md](review-notes.md)** - Periodic review and reflection on metrics

---

## Principles

- Metrics should support project goals, not replace judgment
- What is measured should reflect what is valued
- Non-code contributions should be visible in metrics
- Metrics are reviewed and updated as understanding evolves
