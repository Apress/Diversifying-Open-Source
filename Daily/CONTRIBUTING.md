## Getting started

1. Check open issues with labels like:
   - `good-first-issue`
   - `help-wanted`
   - `needs-review`
   - `needs-docs`
   - `needs-a11y`
2. Comment on the issue to signal interest.
3. Ask questions early — clarification is encouraged.

## Submitting changes

- Use clear, descriptive titles.
- Describe *why* the change is needed, not only *what* changed.
- If your contribution is non-code, say so explicitly.

## Review expectations

Reviews are meant to support learning and quality, not to gatekeep.

You can expect:
- respectful feedback
- explanations when changes are requested
- help navigating project norms

You can request:
- a slower review
- clarification instead of judgment
- guidance from a maintainer or peer
