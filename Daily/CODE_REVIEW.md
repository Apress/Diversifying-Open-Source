# Code Review

Code review is treated as a **collaborative practice**, not as a quality gate.

The goal is shared understanding and long-term maintainability.

## For reviewers

When reviewing:

- explain *why* a change is requested
- distinguish between suggestions and requirements
- avoid assuming prior knowledge
- consider readability and future maintainers

Ask questions before making assumptions.

---

## For contributors

When receiving review:

- questions are not criticism
- requests for changes are part of the process
- you may ask for clarification or alternatives

If feedback feels unclear or overwhelming, say so.

---

## What reviews usually cover

- correctness and clarity
- maintainability
- documentation impact
- accessibility or usability impact (when relevant)

---

## Disagreements

If consensus is hard to reach:

1. clarify the underlying concern
2. document trade-offs
3. ask for a third perspective if needed
