# Support

Support is treated as shared infrastructure, not as an individual burden.

This document explains **where to ask what**, so questions do not get lost or misplaced.

## Where to get help

- Questions and discussions: [link]
- Bug reports: Issues
- Feature ideas: Issues
- Security concerns: see [Procedural/SECURITY.md](Procedural/SECURITY.md)

If you are unsure where your question belongs, start with the discussion channel.

## What to include

When asking for help, try to include:

- what you are trying to do
- what you expected to happen
- what actually happened
- any relevant context (version, environment, screenshots)

Incomplete questions are still welcome.

---

## Response expectations

This is a best-effort, volunteer-driven project.

- Typical response time: [e.g. a few days]
- No response does not mean your question is unwelcome
- You are encouraged to follow up politely

---

## Accessibility and language

- Plain-language questions are welcome.
- You may ask for clarification, summaries, or slower explanations.
- Accessibility-related questions should be clearly marked.
