# Governance

This document functions as the **constitutional foundation** of the project.

Governance defines the basic conditions under which the project operates:
how authority is exercised, how responsibility is distributed,
how inclusion and equity are safeguarded,
and how continuity is guaranteed beyond individual contributors.

It exists to ensure that decisions do not depend on proximity, availability,
informal influence, or accumulated power.

Governance is slow by design.
It prioritizes legitimacy, ethics, and long-term trust over efficiency.

## Purpose of governance

Governance in this project exists to:

- guarantee ethical conduct and accountability
- protect diversity, equity, and inclusion among stakeholders
- constrain the concentration of power
- define legitimate paths to leadership and responsibility
- ensure continuity through role rotation and succession
- provide clear mechanisms for stepping down and sunsetting roles and projects
- enable repair when harm or imbalance occurs

---

## Scope of governance

Governance applies to:

- the definition and revision of long-term documents
- project direction and priorities
- allocation of shared authority and responsibility
- stewardship of community health and safety
- escalation and resolution of disputes
- appointment, rotation, and removal of leadership roles
- decisions with long-term impact on contributors and users

Day-to-day coordination and repeatable processes are handled elsewhere.
This document defines what must hold across time.

---

## Governance as a constitutional document

This governance document functions as a **constitution**.

It establishes:
- ethical boundaries that cannot be overridden by convenience
- guarantees of equitable participation
- limits on authority and decision-making power
- rules for leadership legitimacy
- mechanisms for accountability and repair

---

## Governance model

Describe the governance model used by the project:

- consensus-seeking
- council-based
- voting-based
- hybrid

The chosen model must be documented along with:
- who participates
- how decisions are reached
- how disagreement is handled
- how outcomes are recorded

No governance model is neutral.
The project commits to reviewing whether the model continues to support equitable participation and shared responsibility.

---

## Participation, diversity, and equity

Participation in governance may include:
- maintainers
- contributors
- other stakeholders affected by the project

Eligibility criteria and expectations must be explicit.

Governance actively works to:
- lower barriers to participation
- support asynchronous and distributed input
- avoid reliance on informal or opaque networks

Silence, absence, or lack of availability is not treated as consent.

Patterns of exclusion, underrepresentation, or overburdening are treated as governance concerns requiring attention and action.

---

## Decision-making

All governance decisions follow a documented process:

1. A proposal is introduced (issue or pull request)
2. Context, goals, and constraints are recorded
3. A discussion period is opened
4. Input is collected, including asynchronous input
5. A decision is reached using the agreed model
6. The outcome and rationale are documented

Decisions that affect governance, ethics, inclusion, or long-term responsibility must be recorded in the decision log.

---

## Leadership and stewardship

Leadership in this project is understood as **stewardship**, not ownership.

Leaders are entrusted with responsibility for continuity, care, and coordination, not unilateral control.

Leadership roles must have:
- clear scope and limits
- explicit responsibilities
- documented expectations
- defined accountability paths

---

## Role rotation and succession

To prevent power from concentrating through habit, the project offers mechanisms for:

- rotation of leadership and coordination roles
- shared responsibility where possible
- planned succession
- temporary delegation in cases of absence

Rotation schedules and succession processes are defined procedurally and reviewed regularly.

Continuity must not depend on any single individual.

---

## Stepping down and sunsetting roles

The project guarantees **safe, dignified paths to step down**.

Stepping down:
- does not require justification
- does not imply failure
- should prioritize continuity and handover

Sunsetting a role or project includes:
- documenting why is ending
- redistributing or retiring responsibilities
- ensuring no hidden obligations remain

Exit mechanisms are a governance responsibility, not a personal burden.

---

## Ethics and accountability

Ethical commitments include:
- respect for human rights and dignity
- opposition to discrimination and harassment
- care for contributors and users
- accountability for impact, not only intent

Violations of these commitments are addressed through established conduct and restorative processes.

Ethical concerns cannot be dismissed as interpersonal issues.

---

## Relationship to metrics and signals

Governance decisions may be informed by procedural signals, including community health and sustainability metrics (such as those inspired by CHAOSS).

Metrics:
- provide signals, not judgments
- inform reflection, not legitimacy
- never replace lived experience or qualitative input

Governance is not delegated to dashboards.

---

## Transparency and documentation

Governance decisions and reviews are documented
to the extent possible while respecting privacy and safety.

The rationale for decisions should be legible to future contributors.

Institutional memory is a shared responsibility.

---

## Review and amendment

This governance document is reviewed periodically.

Amendments require:  
- explicit proposal  
- documented discussion  
- clear agreement  
- recorded outcome  

Changes to governance are treated as long-term events and should not be rushed.

---

## Limits

No governance document can anticipate every situation.

When gaps appear:
- care and safety take precedence
- qualitative experience is valued
- governance adapts rather than defers responsibility

Governance exists to protect the conditions for equitable collaboration over time.
