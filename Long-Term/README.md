project that carry **responsibility, legitimacy, and memory across time**.

## Contents

- **[OWNERSHIP.md](OWNERSHIP.md)** - Ownership structure and rights
- **[MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)** - Maintainer information and responsibilities

## Purpose

These documents define the long-term structure, governance, and legal
framework of the project. They are updated infrequently and represent
foundational commitments and structures.
Long-term is not about daily coordination or repeatable procedure.
It defines who can decide, who is accountable, how harm is addressed, and
what obligations persist beyond individual contributors.

These documents are rarely read.
When they are needed, they must be trustworthy.

Changes here should be slow, deliberate, and explicitly recorded.
