# Long-Term Governance

This directory contains long-term governance and legal documents for the
project that carry **responsibility, legitimacy, and memory across time**.

These texts are rarely read — but when they are, the project's credibility
depends on them.
They change slowly and require explicit consent to modify.
They carry institutional memory beyond individual contributors.

Long-term answers questions such as:

- Who decides?
- Who is accountable?
- How is harm addressed?
- How is equity being addressed?
- What obligations persist beyond individuals?

Examples include governance, ownership, maintainer responsibility, codes of
conduct, licensing, credit, and restorative processes.

## Purpose

These documents define the long-term structure, governance, and legal
framework of the project. They are updated infrequently and represent
foundational commitments and structures.
Long-term is not about daily coordination or repeatable procedure.
It defines who can decide, who is accountable, how harm is addressed, and
what obligations persist beyond individual contributors.

These documents are rarely read.
When they are needed, they must be trustworthy.

Changes here should be slow, deliberate, and explicitly recorded.
