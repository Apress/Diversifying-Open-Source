# Daily Operations

The `Daily/` folder contains documents that support **orientation, coordination, and care** in ongoing work.

These texts are consulted frequently.  
They evolve quickly.  
They lower the barrier to participation for newcomers and active contributors alike.

Daily Operations answers questions such as:

- Where do I go?
- Who do I ask?
- What is expected of me?
- How do we interact while work is happening?

Examples include contribution guidance, support channels, review practices,
meeting coordination, and shared communication norms.

## Contents

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Guidelines for contributing to the project
- **[SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)** - Information about getting support
- **[CODE_REVIEW.md](CODE_REVIEW.md)** - Code review guidelines and best practices
- **[MEETINGS.md](MEETINGS.md)** - Meeting documentation and procedures

## Purpose

These documents are designed to be referenced frequently and updated as needed
to reflect current operational practices. They should be easily accessible and
clearly written to help both new and existing contributors understand how to
participate effectively in the project.
