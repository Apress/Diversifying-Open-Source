# Communication Practices

{% if project_name %}This document describes how we try to communicate in {{ project_name }} while work is happening.{% else %}This document describes how we try to communicate while work is happening.{% endif %}

These are shared practices, not rigid rules.

---

## General principles

- assume good intent, stay attentive to impact
- prefer clarity over speed
- ask before escalating
- document outcomes when decisions are made

---

## Asynchronous first

- not everyone is online at the same time
- written input counts as participation
- summaries matter

---

## Reducing information imbalance

- centralize discussions when possible
- avoid private decisions that affect others
- share context generously

---

## When things get tense

- pause before responding
- ask for clarification
- involve a neutral facilitator if needed

If harm occurs, refer to the restorative process.
